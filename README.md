# GOOD
This repository is for an integrated framework for [**G**alaxy morphological classification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxy_morphological_classification) focusing on **O**ut-**O**f-**D**istribution detection and investigation (GOOD).


## Motivation
Galaxy morphological classification is ...


## What is GOOD for?
GOOD is designed to solve three main problems in galaxy morphological classification.

## Dataset

### Galaxy Zoo 2
We utilize an open source dataset called [Galaxy Zoo 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxy_Zoo).
The dataset is released by [Willett et al. (2013)](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/435/4/2835/1022913?login=true) and used for this project.
Following the description by the authors, there are 243,434 images in total.
This is off by about 0.08% from the total count in the tables; since there does not exist any discrepancy for the image sampling, this should work for the research.

Below are some useful links that enabled to collect datasets required for this research.
